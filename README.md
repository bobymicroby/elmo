Elmo is the Android framework from Badge that I use for nearly all product development at [Badge](https://badge.app). When I began creating Elmo, my goal was not to create yet another architecture pattern like MVP, MVC,MVVM, it was to allow even a single person to deliver a large scale application easier, faster, and to have fun in the process. 

Elmo will help you write your android applications in a modern, unidirectional and functional way. You will have easy and great tests for free, and you will never have to deal with concurrency and async issues.

I am a firm believer in functional programming, and I know that for many Android developers this is still uncharted territory, but if you keep reading until the end, I promise you that you will rise again, harder and stronger! For what is immutable my never change!
